      <title>The Best Rum</title>

      <description>Today, I got a text from my dad:
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the best rum&amp;rdquo;
My immediate thought was, &amp;ldquo;idk, Appleton 50 year?&amp;rdquo; I guess that&amp;rsquo;s the most expensive rum. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly helpful though, so I started a dialogue.
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a complicated question with a complicated answer.&amp;rdquo;
He further refined his question.
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the best rum to make silly cocktails with?&amp;rdquo;
Come on now. They&amp;rsquo;re not silly. They have flair. But seriously, it&amp;rsquo;s a bad question.</description>
