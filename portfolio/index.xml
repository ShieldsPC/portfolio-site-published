      <description>Taco Bell, a Yum Brands subsidiary and beloved comfort food provider, made over $2,000,000,000 last year. And yet, somehow, it feels like they spent about $100 on a UX team for their mobile app. I discovered this in mid 2020 when they took my favorite item, the Quesarito, off of the menu and made it an &amp;ldquo;app exclusive.&amp;rdquo; Frustrated, but not defeated, I dutifully installed the Taco Bell app on my iPhone and got my Quesarito.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of buying secondhand premium items on sites like Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve scored some pretty incredible deals. In 2021, I snagged a pair of new-in-box 1970 JBL L100 loudspeakers for $25. That might be the best deal I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten. But enough about the happy parts of the process. What about the negatives?
Problem Statement Negotiating on digital marketplaces typically follows a consistent pattern.</description>

      <title>Smart TV Remotes</title>

      <description>According to a 2023 study by Hub Research, 74% of TV households have a smart TV. Statista says there are 125 million TV households in the United stats. That means that nearly 93 million American homes have smart TVs. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of smart TVs. It&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that the smart TV has kind of become an integral part of the modern American home. And I think the en masse move to the smart TV makes a lot of sense.</description>

      <description>Enhancing Hybrid Learning
Thacher Shields | Nick DeBakey | Danait Teklemariam | Vianca Barlis
Brief This is a design project I lead during my time in the UNC Charlotte Graduate School while earning my Master&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Information Technology. We were tasked with designing a new technology product to improve the &amp;ldquo;hybrid learning&amp;rdquo; experience that took hold during the COVID 19 pandemic. In the hybrid learning environment, half of the class was seated in the classroom while the other half was working from home over Zoom.</description>
