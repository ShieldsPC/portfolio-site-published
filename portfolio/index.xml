      <description>Enhancing Hybrid Learning
Thacher Shields | Nick DeBakey | Danait Teklemariam | Vianca Barlis Design Challenge The design challenge we have selected is the Burson Hall physical/virtual hybrid classroom renovation. We have developed two design goals to improve upon the current structure that will guide the renovation process. In addition, we aim to improve the collaboration process between virtual and in-person students by increasing interaction capabilities across in-person and remote students and mitigating common privacy concerns.</description>

      <description>Thacher Shields | Mahika Sareen | Shaina Glass Organizing your class schedule can be a pain. Getting the perfect line up of classes without getting poorly-rated professors, multiple difficult classes on the same day, or missing out on a prerequisite needed for on-time graduation can seem impossible. That’s why we’re designing a frictionless and user-focused experience that will leverage data analysis to recommend the perfect schedule! With the app, students will be able to link their DegreeWorks output directly to the app, tell the app how hard they think each class will be, and weigh how important they feel it is to get a good professor or a convenient schedule.</description>
