<p>Organizing your class schedule can be a pain. Getting the perfect line up of classes without getting poorly-rated professors, multiple difficult classes on the same day, or missing out on a prerequisite needed for on-time graduation can seem impossible. That’s why we’re designing a frictionless and user-focused experience that will leverage data analysis to recommend the perfect schedule! With the app, students will be able to link their DegreeWorks output directly to the app, tell the app how hard they think each class will be, and weigh how important they feel it is to get a good professor or a convenient schedule. Once the student is happy with their schedule, the app will give the student a list of Course Registration IDs to enter into the UNCC scheduling system to secure their perfect schedule.</p>

<h2 id="need-finding">Need finding</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>We ran two focus groups to further refine our design goals. We organized our focus groups into two sections of 4 participants each. Our first focus group consisted of UNCC Graduate Students studying Health Psychology and the second was a mix of UNCC Computer Science students at different parts of their academic career: a graduate student, an undergraduate alum, an undergraduate student, and an undergraduate dropout.
We started our focus groups with an introduction that explained a little bit about what we are doing and what information we are looking for. We discussed the general Zoom etiquette we hoped to adhere to and proceeded to facilitate our discussion. We asked a series of 9 questions and took the time to try to hear from everyone and ensure that we got a rich collection of opinions and experiences. At the end of each round of questions, we opened the floor to any final thoughts and feedback. Doing so allowed us to gain insight into ideas that weren’t specifically addressed by our questions.
In our testing, we learned a lot more about the processes that students are using to schedule their classes, gained a deeper understanding of common pain points, and brainstormed new ideas for functionality and UX that users wanted to see in their ideal scheduling tool. We plan to use this feedback to refine our design goals and add new functionality that will improve the overall user experience.</p>
<h3 id="participants">Participants</h3>
<p>Participants were recruited by each member of the research team. Each member reached out to friends that are currently, or were previously, UNC Charlotte students (our targeted population). Participants were approached in-person or online to participate in the online user study. Each participant was set a zoom link for the agreed upon time to meet. All participants were in their 20s, and were either a graduate or undergraduate student.</p>
<p><strong>Group 1</strong></p>
<p>Introduced By: Shaina</p>
<p>Facilitated By: Thacher</p>
<ol>
<li>UNCC Graduate Student | Health Psychology major</li>
<li>UNCC Graduate Student | Health Psychology major</li>
<li>UNCC Graduate Student | Health Psychology major</li>

<p><strong>Group 2</strong></p>

<ol start="5">
<li>UNCC Graduate Student | CS major</li>

<li>Former UNCC undergraduate student | Transferred to UNCC | CS major</li>
<li>UNCC undergraduate Alum | CS major</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="discussion-and-insights">Discussion and Insights</h3>
<p>Based on the results of the need finding user study (see Appendix), the design goals do seem to appeal to our intended users, being UNC Charlotte students. Each member of our focus group (groups 1 and 2) expressed struggles with the current scheduling process and stated that a website with more flexibility and visibility would be much more helpful. This fits with our original design goals which specifically mention increasing flexibility and reducing stress. Participants were excited about our concepts with the condition that it had to make the process simpler, rather than just adding another tool on top of the other ones they use. Our design goals align with the multiple tasks the users are already doing such as enrolling in courses and using calendars for scheduling. Our aim is to simplify the steps they already go through with scheduling courses. Our design goals will do this by condensing their steps into one place, rather than multiple.</p>
<p>The participants mentioned a lot of ideas that we had not previously thought of. An example of this is adding an option to preview what a course may look like in their schedule (discussed by group 2), and integrating this website with their google calendars (discussed by group 1). While nothing they suggested came as a surprise, much of what they stated were useful ideas that were not a part of our original plan. From these focus groups, we only had to add these new concepts to our design goals. No design goals were removed. Once these new concepts were added, our design goals adequately reflected user needs that were not previously being encompassed.</p>
<p>Our goals were updated to address user needs, but they were not changed. We added to our list in order to designate specific needs that were not originally met. Our original goals were very general, with the feedback from the focus group, we were able to add goals that mentioned specific design features that would be needed. The design goals that did not need to be updated or refined were our goals of targeting UNC Charlotte students and provide a rich calendar experience, an offered course list, professor difficulty score, user profile. Our focus group consisted of current or past UNC Charlotte students and each participant expressed the need for a less stressful and simpler scheduling process and tool. This verified the students’ needs and allows us to maintain our reasoning for targeting these students specifically. Our last goal also already covered most of the needs of the users. The focus group specifically discussed wanting a visible calendar to show their schedules, wanted an easier way to search through courses and view course information, that information about the professor is very important to them during scheduling, and that they would like some personalization to the courses being shown such that they are shown courses required for their majors.</p>

<p><em>Figure 2: Persona based on group 2 of participants</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Personas were chosen by analyzing the results from the focus group. Specifically analyzing the question, “How did you schedule classes for your most recent semester?”, showed a clear difference between both personas. Persona one was part of another program that required looking at courses in a catalog and then reaching out to the professor for permission to join the class while persona two used a scheduling tool provided by UNC Charlotte to sign up for classes. Another clear distinction between persona one and persona two was that everyone involved in persona one was female (group one) while everyone involved in persona two was male (group two). Group one also had different motivations compared to group two. Group one’s motivation was mostly school and career-focused while group two’s motivation was finding an even balance between social life and school.  This is probably due to the fact that group one consisted of students in graduate courses while group two consisted of people who completed or were working on their undergraduate. With different motivations, each group also had different goals which were reflected within the personas. Steven wanted ways to plan out his school schedule around his social life while Jessica wanted an easier way to get through classes. These goals and motivation are reflected in the frustrations. Both Steven and Jessica feel some frustration when it comes to signing up for classes because they always have multiple tabs open when all they need is a description of the class and who the professor is.</p>
<h3 id="design-goals">Design Goals</h3>
<p>Below are our listed design goals. These goals have been informed by our need finding study and our developed personas. These goals reflect the purpose of Niner Decider which is to simplify the course enrollment process.</p>
<ol>
<li>Relieve stress and give confidence in class scheduling</li>
<li>Provide tools to make an informed decision about class scheduling</li>
<li>Allow students to enroll in classes through the app</li>
<li>Allow students to visualize and compare their schedules</li>
<li>Enable higher flexibility in scheduling options</li>
<li>Google Calendar integration</li>
<li>Block off times for out of school activities</li>
<li>Block of times set by sleep preferences</li>

</ol>
<h3 id="user-journeys-and-storyboards">User Journeys and Storyboards</h3>
<p>Below are our user journeys and storyboards. These user journeys were developed based on our two personas, Jessica and Steven. These journeys highlight their goals and demonstrate how the app will be used. The storyboards reflect the same tasks represented by the user journeys. These demonstrate the impact our app will have on UNC Charlotte students.</p>

<h4 id="setting-a-sleep-schedule">Setting a Sleep Schedule</h4>
<p>Steven likes to stay up late and often finds that he has trouble waking up in time to go to classes. He wants to make sure he doesn’t register for any early classes, so he uses the sleep schedule setting in the app. He opens the app, adds his sleep settings, and gets plenty of sleep before his first class. This user journey can be found in Figure 3.To configure his sleep goal settings, Steven opens the hamburger menu on the top left of the home screen (Figure 9). He then selects the “Sleep Goal” item (Figure 10). From there, he enters his desired sleep goal settings using the keypad (Figure 12).</p>
