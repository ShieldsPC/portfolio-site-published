      <description>This website is built using a technology called Hugo. Hugo is brilliant because you can write as little or as much html, css, and js as you want. Written in Go, Hugo is a lightweight and immensely fast content management system. Think Wordpress, but using Markdown instead of PHP. Well I love it and I&amp;rsquo;ve committed to using it for my personal site. Now that I have a few weeks&amp;rsquo; experience under my belt, it&amp;rsquo;s time to get serious about deployment and organization.</description>

      <title>The Best Rum</title>

      <description>Today, I got a text from my dad:
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the best rum&amp;rdquo;
My immediate thought was, &amp;ldquo;idk, Appleton 50 year?&amp;rdquo; I guess that&amp;rsquo;s the most expensive rum. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly helpful though, so I started a dialogue.
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a complicated question with a complicated answer.&amp;rdquo;
He further refined his question.
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the best rum to make silly cocktails with?&amp;rdquo;
Come on now. They&amp;rsquo;re not silly. They have flair. But seriously, it&amp;rsquo;s a bad question.</description>

      <description>Hi. My name is Thacher. I&amp;rsquo;m a UX designer with too many hobbies. Among them are driving, tech, coding, and mixology. On this site, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a collection of ramblings about things that I find interesting, my professional portfolio, and a guide to being a competent home bartender. Until further notice, this site is still heavily under development and incomplete. Thanks for dropping by!

      <description>Enhancing Hybrid Learning
Thacher Shields | Nick DeBakey | Danait Teklemariam | Vianca Barlis
Design Challenge The design challenge we have selected is the Burson Hall physical/virtual hybrid classroom renovation. We have developed two design goals to improve upon the current structure that will guide the renovation process. In addition, we aim to improve the collaboration process between virtual and in-person students by increasing interaction capabilities across in-person and remote students and mitigating common privacy concerns.</description>
