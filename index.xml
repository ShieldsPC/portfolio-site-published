      <title>The Best Rum</title>

      <description>Today, I got a text from my dad:
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the best rum&amp;rdquo;
My immediate thought was, &amp;ldquo;idk, Appleton 50 year?&amp;rdquo; I guess that&amp;rsquo;s the most expensive rum. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly helpful though, so I started a dialogue.
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a complicated question with a complicated answer.&amp;rdquo;
He further refined his question.
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the best rum to make silly cocktails with?&amp;rdquo;
Come on now. They&amp;rsquo;re not silly. They have flair. But seriously, it&amp;rsquo;s a bad question.</description>

      <description>Hi. My name is Thacher. I&amp;rsquo;m a UX designer with too many hobbies. Among them are driving, speakers, coding, and mixology. On this site, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a collection of ramblings about things that I find interesting, my professional portfolio, and a guide to being a competent home bartender. Until further notice, this site is still heavily under development and incomplete. Thanks for dropping by!</description>

      <description>Enhancing Hybrid Learning
Thacher Shields | Nick DeBakey | Danait Teklemariam | Vianca Barlis Design Challenge The design challenge we have selected is the Burson Hall physical/virtual hybrid classroom renovation. We have developed two design goals to improve upon the current structure that will guide the renovation process. In addition, we aim to improve the collaboration process between virtual and in-person students by increasing interaction capabilities across in-person and remote students and mitigating common privacy concerns.</description>

      <description>Thacher Shields | Mahika Sareen | Shaina Glass Organizing your class schedule can be a pain. Getting the perfect line up of classes without getting poorly-rated professors, multiple difficult classes on the same day, or missing out on a prerequisite needed for on-time graduation can seem impossible. That’s why we’re designing a frictionless and user-focused experience that will leverage data analysis to recommend the perfect schedule! With the app, students will be able to link their DegreeWorks output directly to the app, tell the app how hard they think each class will be, and weigh how important they feel it is to get a good professor or a convenient schedule.</description>
