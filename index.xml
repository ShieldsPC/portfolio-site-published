      <description>So you want to mix drinks. You&amp;rsquo;ll need some tools to get started. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through the tools you&amp;rsquo;ll need, the brands and products I recommend, and what to avoid. Everything you need can be found on Amazon and is relatively cheap. If you want to grab an easy starter kit, grab the Barfly Essential Kit. If you&amp;rsquo;d rather assemble your kit on your own, this list will help you figure out what you need.</description>

      <description>This website is built using a technology called Hugo. Hugo is brilliant because you can write as little or as much html, css, and js as you want. Written in Go, Hugo is a lightweight and immensely fast content management system. Think Wordpress, but using Markdown instead of PHP. Well I love it and I&amp;rsquo;ve committed to using it for my personal site. Now that I have a few weeks&amp;rsquo; experience under my belt, it&amp;rsquo;s time to get serious about deployment and organization.</description>

      <description>Hi. My name is Thacher. I&amp;rsquo;m a UX designer with too many hobbies. Among them are driving, tech, coding, and mixology. On this site, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a collection of ramblings about things that I find interesting, my professional portfolio, and a guide to being a competent home bartender. Until further notice, this site is still heavily under development and incomplete. Thanks for dropping by!

      <description>Enhancing Hybrid Learning
Thacher Shields | Nick DeBakey | Danait Teklemariam | Vianca Barlis
Design Challenge The design challenge we have selected is the Burson Hall physical/virtual hybrid classroom renovation. We have developed two design goals to improve upon the current structure that will guide the renovation process. In addition, we aim to improve the collaboration process between virtual and in-person students by increasing interaction capabilities across in-person and remote students and mitigating common privacy concerns.</description>
