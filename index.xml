      <description>Taco Bell, a Yum Brands subsidiary and beloved comfort food provider, made over $2,000,000,000 last year. And yet, somehow, it feels like they spent about $100 on a UX team for their mobile app. I discovered this in mid 2020 when they took my favorite item, the Quesarito, off of the menu and made it an &amp;ldquo;app exclusive.&amp;rdquo; Frustrated, but not defeated, I dutifully installed the Taco Bell app on my iPhone and got my Quesarito.</description>

      <description>In my two years in the enterprise UX space, I&amp;rsquo;ve gained a number of soft skills that they didn&amp;rsquo;t prepare me for in college. At no point in my undergrad or masters programs did my instructors tell me that I&amp;rsquo;d have to tell people no. Learning that lesson took real on-the-job experience. Today, I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about the relationship between product managers and UX designers.
The Relationship During my time as a Senior User Experience Designer, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked closely with several key stakeholders for each of my projects.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of buying secondhand premium items on sites like Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve scored some pretty incredible deals. In 2021, I snagged a pair of new-in-box 1970 JBL L100 loudspeakers for $25. That might be the best deal I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten. But enough about the happy parts of the process. What about the negatives?
Problem Statement Negotiating on digital marketplaces typically follows a consistent pattern.</description>

      <title>Smart TV Remotes</title>

      <description>According to a 2023 study by Hub Research, 74% of TV households have a smart TV. Statista says there are 125 million TV households in the United stats. That means that nearly 93 million American homes have smart TVs. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of smart TVs. It&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that the smart TV has kind of become an integral part of the modern American home. And I think the en masse move to the smart TV makes a lot of sense.</description>

      <title>How to Deploy your Hugo Site to cPanel Using GitHub Actions</title>

      <description>This website is built using a technology called Hugo. Hugo is brilliant because you can write as little or as much html, css, and js as you want. Written in Go, Hugo is a lightweight and immensely fast static site generator. Think Wordpress, but using Markdown instead of PHP. Well I love it and I&amp;rsquo;ve committed to using it for my personal site. Now that I have a few weeks&amp;rsquo; experience under my belt, it&amp;rsquo;s time to get serious about deployment and organization.</description>

      <description>Hi! My name is Thacher. I&amp;rsquo;m a Senior User Experience Designer in North Carolina and I&amp;rsquo;m hooked on learning new things. Like this website, for example. I built it using Hugo and I&amp;rsquo;m still working out the kinks (pardon our dust). As a Senior UX Designer, I strive to make complicated tasks intuitive and delightful. I take great pleasure in figuring out new ways to do things and making it fun to do them.</description>

      <description>Enhancing Hybrid Learning
Thacher Shields | Nick DeBakey | Danait Teklemariam | Vianca Barlis
Brief This is a design project I lead during my time in the UNC Charlotte Graduate School while earning my Master&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Information Technology. We were tasked with designing a new technology product to improve the &amp;ldquo;hybrid learning&amp;rdquo; experience that took hold during the COVID 19 pandemic. In the hybrid learning environment, half of the class was seated in the classroom while the other half was working from home over Zoom.</description>
